## Overview
These are the main topics of the Pac-Man AI Projects. 

I implemented many advanced Searching, Reinforcement Learning, and Machine Learning algorithms for Pac-Man to plan out paths to efficiently eat all the dots while evading ghosts.

Please click on the topics you are interested and read the **README.md** file. I've labeled the files I implemented of algorithms, and the **README.md** file will demonstrate the differences and effects for different algorithms.

## Topics

### [Search](Search)
Implement __depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A*__ search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
### [Multi-Agent Search](multiagent)
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implement multiagent __minimax and expectimax__ algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
### [Reinforcement Learning](reinforcement)
Implement __Value Function, Q learning, and Approximate Q learning__ to help pacman and crawler agents learn rational policies.
### [Bayes Nets and Hidden Markov Model](tracking)
Pacman uses probabilistic inference on __Bayes Nets__ and the __forward algorithm and particle sampling in a Hidden Markov Model__ to find ghosts given noisy readings of distances to them.
### [Machine Learning](machinelearning)
Implement the __perceptron algorithm, neural network, and recurrent nn models__, and apply the models to several tasks including digit classification and language identification.
