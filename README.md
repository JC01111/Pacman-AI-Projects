# Pacman-AI-Projects
These are the main topics of the Pacman AI Projects. 

I implemented many advanced Searching, Reinforcement Learning, and Machine Learning algorithms for Pacman to plan out paths to efficiently eat all the dots and escapce from the ghosts.

Please click on the topics you are interested and read the **README.md** file. I've labeled the files I implemented of algorithms, and the **README.md** file will demonstrate the differences and effects for different algorithms.
