# Search Algorithms

In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. The general search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, Heuristic) will be applied to Pacman scenarios.

## 1. Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Depth First Search
In `searchAgents.py`, the fully implemented `SearchAgent` plans out a path through Pacmanâ€™s world and then executes that path step-by-step.

First, test that the `SearchAgent` is working correctly by running:
```bash
python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch
```
