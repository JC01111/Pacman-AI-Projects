# Search Algorithms

In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. The general search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, Heuristic) will be applied to Pacman scenarios.

## 1. Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Depth First Search
In `searchAgents.py`, the fully implemented `SearchAgent` plans out a path through Pacmanâ€™s world and then executes that path step-by-step.

First, test that the `SearchAgent` is working correctly by running:
```bash
python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch
```

Then, I implemented the graph search version of DFS in `depthFirstSearch` function in `search.py`.
Now test the result by:
```python
python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -z .5 -p SearchAgent
```
You should see the mediumMaze like this:

## 2. Breadth First Search
I implemented the BFS algorithm in the `breadthFirstSearch` function in `search.py`. 

We can test on the same way by running:
```python
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5
```

You should see the mediumMaze like this:
